# Crashly
An application that is going to crash, a lot, because that's what it's meant to do.

This application is designed in order to be a platform to play with a few crash logging libraries.
It goes through a few common crashes in Android applications randomly selected ( Mostly I just went on StackOverflow trying to find common issues).
